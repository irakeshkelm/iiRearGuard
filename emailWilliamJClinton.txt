Please forward to William (aka Bill) Clinton


Hi William,


I am very much interested in having a conversation with you, context
would be, as a Southerner. It would be great, if we can meet over
fried chicken, some biscuits and chilled coke on a white southern
colonial porch.


Please, do invite me over to your place, at your convenience.


You are always and most welcome, to stop by my humble residence at 7
Elm Street, Exurban - NY, Binghamton, NY 13905. USA (aka United slave
america, aka Romani america).


Zoom, me a response at your convenience.


Thank you,
Rakesh.
Independent interest and Militia
USA (aka United slave america aka Romani america).
